# Password Security Best Practices

## Why Password Security Matters

Passwords are the first line of defense against unauthorized access. Weak passwords are responsible for 81% of data breaches (Verizon Data Breach Report).

## Strong Password Requirements

A strong password should have:
- **Minimum 12 characters** (ideally 16+)
- **Mix of uppercase and lowercase letters**
- **Numbers and special characters** (!@#$%^&*)
- **No dictionary words** or common patterns
- **No personal information** (birthdays, names, etc.)

### Examples

❌ Bad: `Password123`, `John1990`, `qwerty`
✅ Good: `Tr0pic@l-M0nkey-47!Dancing`, `Bk$9mZ#pLq2wX`

## Password Management

### Password Managers (Recommended)
- **1Password** - User-friendly, cross-platform
- **Bitwarden** - Open-source, free tier available
- **LastPass** - Popular, cloud-synced

**Benefits:**
- Generate strong, unique passwords
- Auto-fill credentials
- Encrypted vault
- Only remember one master password

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Enable MFA wherever possible:
1. **SMS codes** (least secure, but better than nothing)
2. **Authenticator apps** (Google Authenticator, Authy)
3. **Hardware keys** (YubiKey, Titan - most secure)

**MFA reduces account compromise by 99.9%** (Microsoft).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Reusing passwords** across multiple sites
2. **Sharing passwords** via email or chat
3. **Writing passwords** on sticky notes
4. **Using simple patterns** (Password1, Password2, etc.)
5. **Never changing passwords** after a breach

## Password Rotation Policy

- **Critical accounts** (banking, email): Change every 90 days
- **Work accounts**: Follow company policy (usually 60-90 days)
- **Low-risk accounts**: Change only if breach suspected
- **Immediately change** if you suspect compromise

## Breach Detection

Check if your passwords have been compromised:
- **Have I Been Pwned** (haveibeenpwned.com)
- Enter your email to see if it appears in known breaches
- Many password managers integrate this check

## Recovery Options

Set up secure recovery methods:
- **Backup email** (different provider than primary)
- **Recovery phone number** (keep updated)
- **Security questions** (use fake answers stored in password manager)
- **Backup codes** (print and store securely)
